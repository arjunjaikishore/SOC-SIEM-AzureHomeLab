<h1>üõ°Ô∏è Security Operations Center (SOC) Home Lab</h1>

<h2><br />Description</h2>
This SOC Simulation Home Lab was my attempt on getting hands-on experience with SOC and SIEM workflows in the cloud. I deployed a vulnerable Windows VM in Microsoft Azure, configured log forwarding into Log Analytics, and enabled Microsoft Sentinel for monitoring and alerting. To generate real-world data, I exposed the VM to the internet for several hours and allowed brute-force login attempts to occur. I configured Sentinel to not only detect and alert on these attempts, but also plot the attacker IP address locations on a world map, giving me visibility into where the activity was originating globally. I then used KQL queries to investigate the events further, which helped me practice log analysis, detection engineering, and incident response techniques.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- KQL (Kusto Query Language)
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM platform)
- Azure Log Analytics Workspace
- Windows Event Viewer
- Remote Desktop Protocol

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- Microsoft Azure
- Windows 10 (Virtual Machine)
- Windows 11 (Local Machine)

<h2>Simulation walk-through:</h2>

**1. Created Azure Resources** - Set up a Resource Group and Virtual Network in Microsoft Azure.

<br />
<br />
<br />
**2. Deployed Windows VM** - Launched a Windows 10 virtual machine, configured credentials, and enabled RDP access via a Network Security Group (port 3389).

<br />
<br />
<br />
**3. Connected Logs to Azure Monitor** - Installed/activated the Azure Monitor agent and linked the VM to a Log Analytics Workspace.

<br/>
**4. Enabled Microsoft Sentinel** ‚Äì Using Microsoft Defender, activated Sentinel on the workspace to provide SIEM functionality.

<br />
<br />
<br/>
**5. Configured Data Collection** - Forwarded Windows Security Event Logs (failed/successful logins, account activity) into Log Analytics.

<br />
<br/>
<br />
**6. Exposed the VM** - Left RDP open to the internet for several hours to attract real brute-force login attempts.

<br />
<br/>
<br />
**Generated and Collected Attack Data** - Allowed unsolicited login attempts to accumulate, producing authentic attack traffic.

<br/>
<br />
**7. Investigated with KQL** ‚Äì Queried the log data using Kusto Query Language to dig deeper into failed logins, attacker IPs, and timelines.

<br/>
<br />
**8. Geographic Mapping** ‚Äì Used Sentinel‚Äôs built-in map feature to visualize attacker IP addresses by country/region.

<br />
<br />
<br/>
**9. Validated End-to-End Workflow** ‚Äì Confirmed that log collection, alerting, visualization, and investigation worked together like a real SIEM environment.
